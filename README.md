# MATHEMATICA AS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND SOFTWARE - Mathematica code, projets and exercises.

These files are a collection of Mathematica (9.0) notebooks: 

- practice2012: 

This is a series of solved exercises that I did as a training before attending on July 2013 the Wolfram Science Summer School (WSSS) in Boston (MA).

- practice2013:

These are exercises and assignments that I did before and during the WSSS.

Turing Machine:

homeworkTM_5_3.nb -> This notebook describe the Turing Machine with 5 States and 3 Colors (more details here: http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TuringMachine.html). There are 30^15 possible different rules of evolution, from an initial state. The goal of the homework was to find some interesting TMs. I created two criteria, one based on the average width of the TM during its evolution (that helps to exclude the trivial TMs), and the other one based on the entropy, that means the larger the entropy the better. I also observed how widths are distributed in a random sample of 10^4 TMs. And I selected my favorite TM.
